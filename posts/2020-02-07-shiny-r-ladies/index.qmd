Earlier this year I had the pleasure of talking about R [`shiny`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=shiny){target="_blank"} at the [Baltimore R-Ladies](https://rladies-baltimore.github.io/){target="_blank"} Meetup. `shiny` is an R package for building interactive web applications.

We made an app showing the wildfires in south eastern Australia along with historic rainfall and temperature data. This dataset was provided as a [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-01-07/readme.md) dataset by the R for Data Science Learning Community.

Here is a peak at the app...
